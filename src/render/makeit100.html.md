makeit100 is a collection of 100 microexperiments in art and code. The project is ongoing and will be documented here and/or [on GitHub](http://www.github.com/hxlnt/makeit100).

## The makeit100 manifesto

1. **Be small** A microexperiment is a low-risk way to try something new. It doesn't constitute a completed project. A microexperiment doesn't need to have an application, point, or purpose outside of freeform learning.
2. **Be unoriginal** Microexperiments will likely build on the previous work of others or myself; some might even be repeats or do-overs of previous makeit100 microexperiments.
3. **Be messy** The code and execution won't be perfect. It's OK.
4. **Reflect on the process** Each microexperiment should be followed by documentation and/or some kind of personal reflection or takeaway.
