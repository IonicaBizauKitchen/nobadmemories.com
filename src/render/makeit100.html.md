makeit100 is a collection of 100 microexperiments in art and code. My goal is to complete and document all 100 projects in 2017 through this website and [on GitHub](http://www.github.com/hxlnt/makeit100).

## The makeit100 manifesto

1. A microexperiment is a low-risk way to try something new. It doesn't constitute a completed project nor is it necessarily even a good idea.
2. A microexperiment doesn't need to have an application, point, or purpose outside of freeform learning.
3. Microexperiments will likely build on previous work; some may even repeat it in part or whole.
4. The code will probably be messy.
5. Each microexperiment will be followed by documented and personal reflection.


## The microexperiments

  1.  **Phenotyped** A visualization of simple Mendelian codominance over five generations of flowers.
