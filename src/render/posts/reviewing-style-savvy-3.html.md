Kenneth Burke once made the observation that literary critics don't tell us about books but about themselves. Indeed, so much of the critic's work rests in convincing us that he or she is sufficiently knowledgeable, experienced, authoritative, refined in taste, able to parse nuanced undercurrents invisible to mass audiences, yet also sophisticated enough to appreciate popular culture if and when such a thing is permissible. Justifications, caveats, 

The same observation can be applied to the work of video game reviewers, and nowhere is this autobiographical process more visible than in the review of girly games. In 2013, I reviewed IGN's coverage of girly Nintendo DS games and found that in 100% of the games reviewed, the author devoted a portion, often a *significant* portion, of the review to distancing himself from the game or its supposed target audience.

"When Super Princess Peach arrived in the IGN offices, the box it came in literally permeated the air with an overwhelmingly flowery, peach scent. Call it a clue to where Nintendo's targeting its new platformer. Though the final, released game won't be covered in perfume, it should be clear to you just by the title what you're getting into: a Mario-style game that's more likely than not aimed at a more feminine, and less hardcore, girl audience. Even with this aim, Nintendo still manages to produce a fine platformer with plenty of references to its classic Mushroom Kingdom franchise. Just keep in mind that it won't be nearly as challenging to complete."

Why doesn't the writer take on the journalistic challenge of making an earnest attmept to understand what fans enjoy about a given girly-girl series or IP? Or why doesn't a senior editor assign the review to someone who already "gets it?" I am bored--not offended, not demeaned, simply *bored*--by lazy video game reviews that make breezy generalizations and remove all nuance from a fandom only to suggest that the game's mindless audience enjoys the game by virtue of some kind of corporate brainwashing. 

I am bored--not demeaned, not offended, BORED--of lazy reviews like this. 

"It sucks, but girls will like it!" Because girls like crappy games? Because girls have bad taste?

"Here's another girl-oriented franchise trying to shamelessly capitalize on its mindless fans!" Gee, thanks.

"It's easy too easy for me, Real Video Game Man, but girls will love it!" What? Seriously? 

Imagine if *Star Wars* games were reviewed with the same approaches!

"Look, I don't know what a "Jedi" is, and I hope I never have to find out. But let's be clear, the latest *Star Wars* title is not for *real* gamers. It is instead an attempt by Disney to cash in on the mindless, frothing target audience of males who idolize the Lightsaber-weilding Han Solo. The game's plot is boring, the gameplay repetitive, but young men will certainly find hours of entertainment herein."



I started playing Style Savvy 3 last week, and I hate to say it, but... it's not that good, y'all.

It's not bad, but it doesn't have what made the first two games magic.
