I'm spending my Friday night with a good pop playlist and a telephone hacking project.

I flipped on a rotating LED light bulb in my studio, and now my bench now looks like a diorama set of the original *Star Trek*. Oh, how I love *Star Trek*'s colorful spot lighting...

Also, shoutout to  the creepy alien shadow that's cast behind the oscilloscope at the right.
