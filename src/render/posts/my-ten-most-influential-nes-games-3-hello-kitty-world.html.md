This is the third in a series of posts about NES games. As I described in [an earlier post](/my-ten-most-influential-nes-games-4-pinball), I've decided to share my highly subjective, personal top-ten list of NES games based on how **influential** they were to me, one at a time and in no particular order. *Hello Kitty World* easily snags the #3 spot on my top-ten NES list.

Do you know the classic NES game *Balloon Fight?* There was a cute sequel for the Game Boy called *Balloon Kid*. The game features Alice, a girl armed with balloons who can float over and around various obstacles that would pop her balloons. When on a platform, Alice can inflate a new balloon&mdash;via rapid button mashing&mdash;to replace one that's been popped. And then she's off to float on by to the end of the level.

The *Balloon Kid* soundtrack was created by music legend Hip Tanaka, responsible for the soundtracks of *Kid Icarus, Metroid, Earthbound, Dr. Mario,* and other Nintendo classics. *Balloon Kid* was released in the US (1990) and Europe (1991) but not Japan&mdash;unusual considering that it was a first-party Nintendo game. No fair, right?!

Fortunately, *Balloon Kid* did get a release of sorts in Japan. In 1992, the game was reskinned and ported to the Famicom. The result? *Hello Kitty World.*

It's a shame that *Hello Kitty World* wasn't released in the US. After all, the game is a first-party NES game featuring Hello-Freaking-Kitty!

*Hello Kitty World* grabbed my attention as a teenager because it was challenging yet cute, made with superstar talent and built on superstar IP yet obscure (at least in the US). *Hello Kitty World* has a mosaic of qualities not often found together in one NES game. It was really *THE* game that had me thinking about alternative timelines in video game history. *What if this game had shipped with the NES console instead of Super Mario Bros.? How would video game history be different today?*

*Hello Kitty World* is the game I used to source most of the graphics for *Hello Kitty Land,* my 2002-2003 *Super Mario Bros.* ROM hack. This hack functions as another way of asking that alternative-history question. *What if...?*

*Hello Kitty World*, with its cute graphics, fun gameplay, and amazing soundtrack, has a super-special place in my heart.
