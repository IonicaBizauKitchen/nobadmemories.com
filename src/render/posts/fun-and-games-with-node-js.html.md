I'm [giving a talk today](http://nobadmemories.com/events/nodevember-2016/) at [Nodevember](http://nodevember.org), a Javascript and node conference taking place in Nashville. My talk, titled "Fun and games with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)," makes two key points:

1. If you want to learn or refresh your skills in Javascript, you should make a game using Node.js. 
2. If you're a Javascript developer, you should teach others how to make a game in Node.js.

One of the difficulties with learning Node.js is that there's a *lot* of assumed prerequisite knowledge. Most Node.js tutorials and books you'll find expect familiarity with Javascript, a good working knowledge of the paradigms of good programming, and an understanding of how web traffic and servers work. They toss around jargon like "asynchronous" and "client-side," words whose meanings are not self-evident. Overly-ornate verbs lead to confusion and intimidation. "Invoke," "execute," "hoist," and "instantiate" are just a few twenty-dollar words, to poorly paraphrase E. B. White, that obscure simple verbs like "make" and "do."

This might not be much of a barrier to folks who have been slinging Javascript for a while. But what if you're new to Javascript? How can beginners overcome the challenge of learning new vocabularies and concepts? Perhaps by making a game. 

Games are familiar, fun, and engaging. They get your creativity and problem-solving skills going, and they are a great opportunity to create and learn on your own in your free time. If you make a game and it sucks, congratulations: you have completed the most important rite of passage, and you are now officially a game developer.

That said, I also encourage more seasoned Node.js developers to make a game and share the code with others who are just starting out. Your fun project might be just the push someone needs to slog through the self-paced learning process.

If you're interested in trying your hand at making a Node.js game, here are a few open-source games and amusements to get you started. Most of these are accompanied by step-by-step tutorials. 
 - [Anagrammatix](https://modernweb.com/2013/09/30/building-multiplayer-games-with-node-js-and-socket-io/): A multiplayer word game by Eric Terpstra.
 - [FrozenBot](http://frozenbot.azurewebsites.net/): A voice-activated singing doll by Gabrielle Crevecoeur.
 - [netpong](https://github.com/OpherV/netpong): An online Pong clone by Opher Vishnia.
 - [Node.js Drawing App](http://tutorialzine.com/2012/08/nodejs-drawing-game/): A collaborative canvas by Martin Angelov.
 - [Real-time Chess](http://dwcares.com/2015/10/21/realchess/): An online chess game by David Washington.

Many of these examples also involve [socket.io](http://socket.io), an easy-to-use Javascript framework for sending data between a node server and clients in real time. The socket.io website has [a tutorial that walks through building a browser-based, real-time chat client](http://socket.io/get-started/) that can be helpful to go through if you're just getting started with websockets and real-time communication. (At the time of writing, the demos on their website weren't working, but perhaps they're all patched up by now.)

Here are links to two fun Node.js projects I built this year. The source code is available for these projects as well.
 - [ConnectedNES](http://www.nobadmemories.com/connectednes): a WiFi modem peripheral and twitter stream for the original NES game console.
 - [the dealwithit bot](http://www.nobadmemories.com/dealwithit): A web app that uses computer vision to drop pixelated shades on everyone in a photo.

And last but not least, here are a few of my favorite developer resources for getting started with Javascript and Node.js.
 - [JavaScript for Cats](http://jsforcats.com/) by Max Ogden
 - [Node.js for Beginners](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/nodejs-for-beginners--net-26314) by Maciej Sopy≈Ço
 - [NODESCHOOL](https://nodeschool.io/) by... lots of collaborators!
 - [Programming--the Real Basics!](https://dev.opera.com/articles/programming-the-real-basics/) by Chris Heilmann

I also keep a running list of coding bookmarks&mdash;all languages, all skill levels&mdash;in the [Resources](http://www.nobadmemories.com/resources) section of No Bad Memories. Do check it out!
