Over the past year, I've found myself thinking up things I wanted to blog about. And each time, the excitement created by this impulse was quickly diminished by the realization that I don't actually have a blog. Or, I <em>didn't</em>. I do now.

I've previously posted scattered writings <a href="http://femicom.org/articles/the-nostalgia-question.php" target="new">from</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@partytimehxlnt/tired-of-logic-video-game-design-women-and-the-language-of-formalism-fd0d35cfa2e2#.95wavg5m2" target="new">time</a> <a href="https://rachelsimoneweil.wordpress.com/2013/03/23/nes-rom-hacks-and-discourses-on-gender-anxieties/" target="new">to</a> <a href="http://www.femicom.org/podcast/" target="new">time</a>, but it's been about seven or eight years since I've had a dedicated place to collect thoughts coherent enough to put online. 

So, I'm looking forward to using this space to share ruminations on pop music, DIY projects, code samples, photos, book recommendations, lists, treatises on art history and art supplies, GIFs, and who knows what else.
