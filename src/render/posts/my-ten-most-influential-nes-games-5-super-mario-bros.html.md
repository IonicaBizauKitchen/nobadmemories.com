For those just tuning in, I decided a few weeks ago to share my highly subjective, personal top-ten list of NES games based on how **influential** they were to me, one at a time and in no particular order. Number 5 on the list is *Super Mario Bros.*

Watching my cousins play *Super Mario Bros.* (Nintendo, 1985) is one of my earliest NES memories. Sometimes, I'd be lucky enough to get in on the rotation for a turn at the controller, and since I was a little kid without an NES and therefore without practice, I'd die almost instantly. Poof! My turn was over just as soon as it had begun.

It's widely agreed that *Super Mario Bros.* is a good game, groundbreaking in its expansiveness, beautifully executed, and forever impressed into the cultural consciousness. I've studied the disassembly of the game, and even its code is elegant and clever. A lot of people have written about this game&mdash;there's [a book dedicated to its soundtrack](https://www.amazon.com/Kondos-Super-Mario-Bros-Soundtrack/dp/1628928530)&mdash;and of course many, many more have played it. I don't know that I have much to add to this, so I'll speak more to how this game has been influential to me personally.

The appeal of *Super Mario Bros.* came to me in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when I discovered an emerging 8-bit art scene and NES game hacking. I wrote about the experience of modifying NES game graphics in [an article for *the Journal of Peer Production*](http://peerproduction.net/issues/issue-8-feminism-and-unhacking/art-essays/the-nostalgia-question-and-feminist-8-bit-game-hacking/):

> While the aesthetic was somewhat familiar to me, it felt entirely new. Iconic video game characters could be modified, improved, and blown up to inordinate sizes on screen, allowing a detailed study of each pixel placed. Game sprites could be redrawn, recolored, and placed back into their native games. And so we got Mario with a cowboy hat, Fat Mario, Astronaut Mario, Nude Mario.

I began to see *Super Mario Bros.* not just as a game but as a symbol for something, a canvas that could be iterated on again and again to say different things about gaming and game culture. It seems simple. It is. But it was a profound idea to me 15 years ago. 

As I mentioned in my post on *[Hello Kitty World](blog/2016/12/my-ten-most-influential-nes-games-3-hello-kitty-world)*, *Super Mario Bros.* was the first game I hacked. I remember the first time I changed its color palette. *I felt so powerful!* My first homebrew NES ROM was a simple starfield with the 1-UP mushroom from *Super Mario Bros.* scrolling by in a looping animation. I hacked *Super Mario Bros.* again in 2015 for a little experiment called *Social Media Bros.*; that project became [ConnectedNES](http://www.nobadmemories.com/connectednes). I've learned important coding concepts from the game, and I've used it to teach others. It continues to represent something above and beyond its gameness.

Thanks, *Super Mario Bros.*, for teaching me and inspiring me to make stuff.
