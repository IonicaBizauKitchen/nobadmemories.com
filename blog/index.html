                <p>I recently had the opportunity to review Paul Atkinson's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Delete-Design-History-Computer-Vapourware/dp/0857853473/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8" target="new"><em>Delete: A Design History of Computer Vapourware</em></a>. <em>Delete</em> is highly recommended for those interested in computer hardware design or retrocomputing. The volume is packed with gorgeous, never-before-seen color images of computers that were announced but never commercially produced. Atkinson's interviews with the designers and executives closest to these unrealized products are fascinating.</p>
                <p>My in-depth review of <em>Delete</em> can be found in the latest issue of <em>Design and Culture</em>. The <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17547075.2015.1051846" target="new">PDF</a> is available for free online. You can also <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/9574086@N02/collections/72157608812198325/" target="new">browse the photo collection</a> of former Sinclair Research designer Rick Dickinson, who worked on a number of the unrealized products chronicled in <em>Delete</em>.</p>
