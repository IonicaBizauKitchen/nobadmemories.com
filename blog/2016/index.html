    <h2>
            Text editor nostalgia
            <sup>Mar 27, 2016</sup>
    </h2>
    
    <p>A few weeks ago, I posted <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/raw-tech/Beginners-Guide-to-VS-Code" target="_blank" rel="external">this ten-minute quickstart video</a> on <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">VS Code</a>, a new open-source code editor from Microsoft. Making the video got me thinking a bit about <em>nostalgia for text editors.</em> Yeah.<br><img src="notepad-lg.jpg" alt="Notepad nostalgia"></p>
<p>For those of you who are web developers, what was the first tool you used to make websites? Was it Notepad? I mean, good old Notepad, right? This barebones text editor has been shipping with Windows for decades and has essentially <em>no features whatsoever</em> for web development. But it was free and got the job done. Its lack of features were actually a point of pride back in the late 1990s and early 2000s. After all, being able to create a website in Notepad meant you knew how to write code without the aid of specialized software like WYSIWYG (“what you see is what you get”) visual editors. And that was something to brag about.</p>
<p>When I started making websites at the age of 12 or 13, I did indeed start with Notepad. I also have a faint memory of using some WYSIWYG editors&mdash;perhaps CoffeeCup, Macromedia Dreamweaver, and FrontPage&mdash;but I don’t remember much about them. The first text editor that I really felt a certain pride or affinity for was <a href="http://www.notetab.com/notetab-light" target="_blank" rel="external">NoteTab Light</a>. <em>I loved NoteTab Light!</em> It allowed you to have <em>multiple documents open as tabs!</em> This feature might seem unremarkable to anyone who has used a modern browser, but this was a truly wonderous acheivement in the late 1990s. NoteTab Light had some other good features, too, like an “Open in Browser” button. What a timesaver! It didn’t have HTML syntax highlighting&mdash;that came with the paid version&mdash;but it was a glorious piece of software nonetheless.<br><img src="notetab.gif" alt="NoteTab Light"></p>
<p>And for more on web dev in the ‘90s, check out <a href="https://zachholman.com/posts/only-90s-developers/" target="_blank" rel="external">“Only 90s Developers Remember This”</a> by Zach Holman. This article reflects on early usage of &amp;nbsp;, CSS link styling, and the venerable 1x1.gif: “Like the most futuristic CSS framework of today but in a billionth of the file size, 1x1.gif is fully optimized for the responsive web.” Ha.</p>

            Delete: A Design History of Computer Vapourware
            <sup>Jan 29, 2016</sup>
    </h2>
    
    <p>I recently had the opportunity to review Paul Atkinson’s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Delete-Design-History-Computer-Vapourware/dp/0857853473/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>Delete: A Design History of Computer Vapourware</em></a>.<br><img src="delete.jpg" alt="Delete"></p>
<p><em>Delete</em> is highly recommended for those interested in computer hardware design or retrocomputing. The volume is packed with gorgeous, never-before-seen color images of computers that were announced but never commercially produced. Atkinson’s interviews with the designers and executives closest to these unrealized products are fascinating.</p>
<p>My in-depth review of <em>Delete</em> can be found in the latest issue of <em>Design and Culture</em>. The <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17547075.2015.1051846" target="_blank" rel="external">PDF</a> is available for free online. You can also <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/9574086@N02/collections/72157608812198325/" target="_blank" rel="external">browse the photo collection</a> of former Sinclair Research designer Rick Dickinson, who worked on a number of the unrealized products chronicled in <em>Delete</em>.</p>
